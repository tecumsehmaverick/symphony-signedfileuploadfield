Field: Signed File Upload
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 1.0
Author: Tony Arnold <tony@tonyarnold.com>
Build Date: Wednesday, 6 May 2009
Requirements: Symphony 2.0.2 or greater.


Installation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Upload the 'signeduploadfield' folder in this archive to your Symphony 'extensions' folder.

2. Enable the extension by selecting the "Field: Signed File Upload", then choosing "Enable" from the with-selected menu, then click "Apply".

3. If you don't already have a private key to use, I've included a simple ruby script to generate one with this extension - 'generate_keys.rb'. Use it if you need to.

3. Go to the Symphony preferences and find the "Signed File Uploads: Private Key" field - paste the contents of your private key into this field and click "Save".

3. You can now add the "Signed File Upload" field to your sections, and files will generate a DSA signature when uploading.
